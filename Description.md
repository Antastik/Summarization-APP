The AI-Powered PDF Summarization and Q&A Application is an advanced tool designed to streamline the process of extracting and summarizing text from PDF documents, and subsequently enabling users to interact with the summarized content via a conversational interface. This project leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to provide an intuitive and efficient means for users to interact with their documents.
Key Features
1. PDF Text Extraction: Efficiently extracts text from PDF documents using the PyPDF2 library.
2. Text Chunking: Splits extracted text into manageable chunks for better processing and summarization.
3. Embeddings and Vector Store: Utilizes local embeddings generated by the Sentence-Transformers library and stores them using FAISS, a scalable vector search library.
4. Conversational Interface: Implements a question-answering system using local language models (such as Llama2) to interact with the summarized content.
5. User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use web interface, allowing users to upload documents, view summaries, and ask questions seamlessly.

Role in Development
As a key contributor to the development of this application, my responsibilities included:

1.Requirement Analysis and Project Planning: Collaborated with stakeholders to understand the project requirements and define the scope. Developed a detailed project plan outlining milestones and deliverables.

2. Architecture Design: Designed the overall architecture of the application, ensuring modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance. Selected appropriate technologies and libraries to meet the project’s needs.

3. Implementation:
    - PDF Text Extraction: Developed the module to extract text from PDF documents using PyPDF2.
    - Text Processing: Implemented text chunking using the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to break down large texts into manageable chunks.
    - Embeddings and Vector Store: Integrated the Sentence-Transformers library to generate text embeddings and utilized FAISS for efficient vector storage and retrieval.
    - Conversational Interface: Configured the transformers library to use local language models for the question-answering functionality, ensuring the application could function without relying on external APIs.
    - Summary Generation: Created a summarization feature to provide users with a concise overview of the document content.

4. User Interface Development: Leveraged Streamlit to build an intuitive web interface that allows users to upload PDF files, view summaries, and interact with the document content through a chat interface.

5. Testing and Optimization: Conducted extensive testing to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the text extraction, summarization, and question-answering features. Optimized the application for performance and scalability.

6. Documentation and Training: Prepared comprehensive documentation detailing the application’s architecture, setup, and usage. Conducted training sessions for team members and end-users to facilitate smooth adoption and usage of the tool.
